# Team-Profile-Generator(CLI)

<p>Project Lead: Brandon Cermak</P>

## User Story ##
As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles. When I start the app with "node app.js", I am then prompted to enter employee-info to create my team's profiles. These profiles will be slightly different based on the role the employee has. Once completed, the CLI will inform you that "the end is here!", and a new html page will be generated.
